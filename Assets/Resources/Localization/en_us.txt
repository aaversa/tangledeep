deathtip_general_header	General Tips
deathtip_monster_header	Corral Tips
deathtip_movement_escape	If you get in over your head, use your <color=yellow>escape portal</color>. It's <color=#40b843>free to activate</color>, but takes some time to warp you away.

deathtip_pets_available	Captured monsters in the <color=yellow>Monster Corral</color> can be <color=#40b843>loyal pets</color>. You had at least one monster <color=yellow>happy enough</color> to be a pet!

deathtip_rangedweapon	You <color=red>don't have a ranged weapon</color>! Having at least one ranged weapon on your hotbar is <color=#40b843>crucial</color>, no matter your job.
deathtip_recovery_flask	Your <color=#40b843>healing flask</color> is essential! It <color=yellow>doesn't take a turn to use</color>, so if things are getting tough, drink up.

Remember that <color=#40b843>Tangledeep</color> is a <color=#40b843>turn-based game</color>: take all the time you need to plan your next action. Also, make sure to <color=red>watch your health</color> if you're running from a fight. It can drop quickly!

dialog_alderwyn_part_1_main_txt	<size=50>An Uneasy Peace</size>\n\nIt has taken many months, but I've worked myself into that ridiculous <color=yellow>Duke Dirtbeak's</color> circle of trust. I can now safely pass through the <color=yellow>Bandit Stronghold</color>, and finally see what lies beyond.\n\nAll of my choices will soon be validated, and my sacrifices justified. I must not let these things weigh heavily until then.\n\nRest assured, I will <color=yellow>have my revenge</color> on the Bandits for their many crimes, once I have returned...\n\n<color=#0cffe6>- Alderwyn</color>
dialog_alderwyn_part_2_main_txt	<size=50>Facts and Figures</size>\n\nMy plans are moving slower than I would like, but I continue to make progress as one of <color=yellow>Duke Dirtbeak's</color> most trusted quartermasters.\n\nHe is an easy boss to please, as he is entirely incapable of reading a single entry on any of the inventory records. Simply pointing at a pile of goods and circling lines on parchment with a shiny red pen are enough to satisfy his curiosity. As such... I'm rich. I can't stop stealing from this fool.\n\n<color=#0cffe6>- Alderwyn</color>
dialog_alderwyn_part_3_main_txt	<size=50>The Big Play</size>\n\nAt last, <color=yellow>Duke Dirtbeak's</color> defeat at my clever hands is nigh!\n\nHe considers me a boon companion and has invited me on his most profitable raids. Tonight, he has asked me to accompany him to our headquarters and fight at his side against some new interloper who has been causing great trouble for him.\n\nApparently he has a magnificent new weapon, gifted to him by the <color=red>'Boss Lady'</color>, that he will use during the attack. In the chaos of conflict, I will avail myself of this weapon to put down the Duke, this interloper, and anyone else who stands in my way!\n\n<color=#0cffe6>- Alderwyn</color>

dialog_armor_walking_1_main_txt	<size=50>Strange Armor - Entry 1</size>\n\nI made an unexpected discovery today while rummaging through the debris of a cave-in: a pile of old, beat-up armor that looks like it has seen many battles. I spent the better part of the day digging it out, and I gotta say, it don't look anything like the armor they sell back home.\n\nAnd the poor soul inside it? Nothing but metal and a bunch of other shiny stuff I can't make heads or tails of. I think if I take that stuff out, there'll be enough space for me to squeeze inside. But where did it come from?\n\nI think I'll be going back to do more digging tomorrow.\n\n<color=#0cffe6> - Zephyr Arsland</color>\n
dialog_armor_walking_2_main_txt	<size=50>Strange Armor - Entry 2</size>\n\nWell, I think I found where that strange suit of armor came from. After I cleared the rubble around that cave-in, I found a path leading to a metal building with a window, but no door.\n\nI peeked in and saw lots and lots of those suits of armor, just walking around on their own!

How about that?\n
dialog_monsterpairing_tips2	#cy#JESSE:#ec# So, match your strong monsters together, make sure one of 'em is #cc#Uncommon#ec# or better, and spend #cg#as much JP as you can#ec# to make the most out of a pairing.

You could just keep whackin' beasties at #cy#random#ec# with a Monster Mallet and bringing them here to check, but #cy#Erin#ec# might know a rumor or two about certain "Wild Untamed" monsters.\n\nThose are sure to be at least #cc#Uncommon#ec#!\n
dialog_monsterpairing_tips3	#cy#JESSE:#ec# How about #cc#abilities#ec#? When you pair 'em together, those two monsters are sure to pass on #cy#at least one ability#ec# they know.\n\nOr they might teach the new monster everything!

dialog_monstertrainer_main_nopet_text	#cy#CAT'IE:#ec# Hello! It's too bad you don't have a #cy#monster buddy#ec# from the #cy#corral#ec#. A good pet is so important out there in Tangledeep.\n\nIf you do bring me a pet, I might be able to teach it some #cc#new tricks#ec#.\n

dialog_npc_frozenscientist_2_bandits_txt	<color=yellow>TRAUMBLEBERT</color>: Bandits?

Perhaps we should be on our guard when the time comes, just in case.\n
dialog_npc_frozenscientist_2_intro_btn_0	You're wide awake, and I'm real. Are you OK?
dialog_npc_frozenscientist_2_intro_txt	<color=yellow>HALF-FROZEN SCIENTIST</color>: ...\n\nAm... am I dreaming? My eyes must deceive me... This cannot be real.\n
dialog_npc_frozenscientist_2_robots_txt	<color=yellow>TRAUMBLEBERT</color>: No, there is no need to worry. These automatons were <color=yellow>harmlessly lumbering about</color> when I arrived, and paid no attention to me.\n\nI observed that they act much like <color=yellow>worker insects</color>. They must have a task to complete, but lack the capacity to do so.\n
dialog_npc_frozenscientist_2_shards_part_1_txt	<color=yellow>TRAUMBLEBERT</color>: Please, help me undo this mistake! You must <color=red>find more Fire Shards</color>.\n

dialog_npc_frozenscientist_2_story1_txt	<color=yellow>HALF-FROZEN SCIENTIST</color>: !!! A voice!\n\nForgive me, it has been so silent for so long, I'm unaccustomed to the sweet sound of speech.\n\nMy name is <color=#40b843>Traumblebert</color>, and long have I dreamt that someone would find me here. The <color=yellow>build-up of Flow</color> must be starting to disperse!\n
dialog_npc_frozenscientist_2_story2_btn_0	How is this possible?
dialog_npc_frozenscientist_2_story2_txt	<color=yellow>TRAUMBLEBERT</color>: Surely you must have noticed the world around you is covered in a <color=#0cffe6>blanket of ice and snow</color>?\n\nIn this place, the invisible, life-giving <color=yellow>Flow</color> that surrounds us has <color=#0cffe6>crystallized</color> into solid matter.\n\nSuch a thing I could have never imagined, until I saw it for myself.\n
dialog_npc_frozenscientist_2_story3_btn_0	I can see that...
dialog_npc_frozenscientist_2_story3_txt	<color=yellow>TRAUMBLEBERT</color>: The <color=yellow>extraction device</color>. I discovered it months ago, and I have been studying it hence.\n\nIt <color=yellow>absorbs Flow</color> from <color=yellow>ancient relics</color>, and releases it in a tangible form. I sought to learn its full capabilities, but something went wrong.\n
dialog_npc_frozenscientist_2_story4_btn_0	How can I help?
dialog_npc_frozenscientist_2_story4_txt	<color=yellow>TRAUMBLEBERT</color>: One such relic I discovered, a <color=yellow>metal rod</color> of sorts, reacted violently when I brought it near the device. It was as if a force repelled me... warned me.\n\nI should have stopped there, but I could not restrain my curiosity. As I set the rod into the device, it began to overload. There was simply <color=yellow>too much Flow</color> to be absorbed.\n\nI could not shut it down in time, and the area was engulfed in crystallized Flow. I suppose it is karma... my punishment for tinkering with the forces of nature.\n\nBut I have been given a second chance. You can help <color=yellow>undo what has been done</color>.\n
dialog_npc_frozenscientist_2_story5_txt	<color=yellow>TRAUMBLEBERT</color>: The <color=red>red shards</color> here, they are a natural regulator of the device. Their latent <color=red>fire energy</color> should counteract the <color=#0cffe6>ice</color> that surrounds us.\n\nI still cannot move. If you help, I will be forever indebted.\n
dialog_npc_frozenscientist_3_ask_items_txt	<color=yellow>TRAUMBLEBERT</color>: Ah, of course! You may have seen some <color=yellow>potions and poultices</color> scattered about. By all means, please take them.\n\nThere is also a cache of <color=#40b843>crystal shards</color> to the northeast. The device would sometimes produce these in reaction to certain relics, but I couldn't find a use for them. Perhaps you will have better luck than I.\n\n
dialog_npc_frozenscientist_3_ask_plans_txt	<color=yellow>TRAUMBLEBERT</color>: I came here with the noblest of intentions: the pursuit of knowledge. Yet I was careless in toying with forces I did not fully understand. I ignored my better judgment.\n\nThere is much still to be learned, but I must proceed with the utmost caution. Some <color=yellow>ancient relics</color> are clearly not to be tampered with.\n
dialog_npc_frozenscientist_3_intro_btn_0	Got anything I could use?
dialog_npc_frozenscientist_3_intro_btn_1	What will you do now?
dialog_npc_frozenscientist_3_intro_txt	<color=yellow>TRAUMBLEBERT</color>: I... I can move once again! I can scarcely believe this day has come, and it's all thanks to you.\n\nFrom the bottom of my heart, <color=#40b843>thank you</color>. If there is anything I can do for you, please, just ask.\n
dialog_npc_unfrozenplunderer_intro_txt	<color=yellow>THAWED BANDIT</color>: W.. wait! Don't hurt us! We were just <color=yellow>hiding</color> from <color=red>Duke Dirtbeak</color>.\n\nHe never treats us well! We do all the work, and he gets all the food. So we ran away...\n\nWe just want to <color=yellow>live in peace</color> in <color=#40b843>Tangledeep</color>. I promise!\n
dialog_openitemworld_info_affinities_btn_0	Back to Main
dialog_openitemworld_info_affinities_txt	Some items have <color=yellow>affinities</color> which may make the Item Dream easier, harder, or just <color=#ffc80a>different</color>. Affinities are <color=yellow>randomly-generated</color> based on the item and any magic properties it already has.\n\nAdding or removing magic properties may change the item affinities, but some may remain.\n\nCarefully consider the risks of the listed affinities before entering an item.\n
dialog_openitemworld_info_lucidorbs_txt	<color=#0cffe6>Lucid Orbs</color> are a special type of <color=yellow>Orb of Reverie</color> that can be used to select a specific <color=yellow>magic property</color> (mod) for your item. Not all Lucid Orbs can be used with every item, however.\n\nYou must still <color=yellow>invest gold</color> if you want your item to receive the mod listed on the <color=#0cffe6>Lucid Orb</color>.\n\nOtherwise, <color=#0cffe6>Lucid Orbs</color> are the same as regular orbs. You will still get a <color=yellow>guaranteed upgrade</color> on your item, if it is capable of receiving one.\n
dialog_openitemworld_info_modifyingitems_txt	Besides <color=yellow>upgrading</color> items and adding new <color=yellow>magic properties</color>, it is possible to alter an item by <color=yellow>removing</color> or <color=red>extracting</color> existing properties.\n\nTo do this, select an item and an orb as usual, then select <color=#40b843>Modify Item</color>.\n\nRemoving mods will make space for new mods, at the cost of some gold and one orb. <color=red>Extracting</color> a mod creates a <color=#0cffe6>Lucid Orb Shard</color> and destroys the item.\n\nGetting three <color=#0cffe6>Lucid Orb Shards</color> of the same type will create a <color=#0cffe6>Lucid Orb</color> of that type. This is a great use for old items that have mods you want to transfer to better items.\n
dialog_openitemworld_info_skillorbs_txt	<color=#40b843>Skill Orbs</color> are a type of <color=#0cffe6>Lucid Orb</color> that can be attached to equipment to <color=yellow>modify one of your skills</color>. Each <color=#40b843>Skill Orb</color> affects a specific ability.\n\nTo attach the orb, you must pay <color=#40b843>JP</color> instead of <color=yellow>Gold</color>. The mod won't do anything unless you know the skill first.\n\nEach piece of gear can carry one <color=yellow>skill mod</color> that does not count toward the item's mod total. This means your mod limit is actually <color=#40b843>six</color> for most items (5 normal + 1 skill mod) and <color=#40b843>nine</color> for two-handed weapons.\n
dialog_openitemworld_info_typesofdreams_txt	<color=yellow>Item Dreams</color> are full of strange environments and creatures. There is no telling what you'll find in each Dream - it's random!\n\nMany dreams have <color=red>charmed monsters</color> that fight for you. Others will have <color=yellow>unusual monsters</color> that are more greedy or aggressive. You may also find <color=yellow>Goldfrogs</color> that carry lots of gold and treasure.\n\nIt is possible to find <color=red>Nightmare Princes</color> in some Item Dreams as well. These bosses drop special items if defeated instead of the <color=yellow>Memory King</color>, and may unlock further secrets. If you do this, you will receive your item with no upgrades.\n
dialog_openitemworld_info_upgrades_txt	Clearing an <color=yellow>Item Dream</color> will give the item a <color=#40b843>guaranteed upgrade</color>. This improves the overall power and quality of the item in some way. Each upgrade is represented by a "+" in the item name.\n\nItems can be upgraded this way up to three times ("+++"). In addition to these guaranteed upgrades, <color=yellow>magic properties</color> (mods) may be added.\n\nFor a chance at a new magic mod, you must add <color=yellow>gold</color> to the Dreamcaster. The more gold you invest, the greater the chance a mod will be added to the item.\n\nItems can have <color=#40b843>up to 5 mods</color> outside their base properties. Two-handed weapons can have <color=#40b843>up to 8</color>.\n

dialog_questgiver_town_intro_btn_buyrumor	(Unused) I'm looking for a specific #cy#type#ec# of rumor...
dialog_questgiver_town_intro_txt	<color=yellow>ERIN</color>: Tangledeep has as many tales as leaves and branches. Legends stand tall like ancient trees, but they're grounded in winding roots and countless stories. <color=yellow>Would you like to make some stories of your own?</color>\n
dialog_questgiver_town_newquest_btn_0	I'll take it!
dialog_questgiver_town_newquest_txt	<color=yellow>ERIN</color>: Here's one way to make a name for yourself...\n
dialog_questgiver_town_nomorequests_txt	<color=yellow>ERIN</color>: The vines have been quiet lately. <color=yellow>Keep adventuring and growing stronger</color>, and maybe they'll speak up.\n\n
dialog_questgiver_town_setrumortype_txt	(Unused) #cy#ERIN:#ec# What we #cy#want#ec# and the opportunities we #cy#have#ec# are often two separate things. 
dialog_questgiver_town_shara_convo1_txt	<color=yellow>ERIN</color>: Shara...?\n\nThat is a name I never expected to hear again. So, she was as strong as they said after all.\n\n
dialog_questgiver_town_shara_convo2_btn_0	You mean, she lived here in Riverstone?
dialog_questgiver_town_shara_convo2_txt	<color=yellow>ERIN:</color> Shara was - IS - a <color=#40b843>force of nature</color>. She is the resilient sapling that pushes through the leaves and branches of other trees to reach the light.\n\nAnd she was <color=yellow>as little as a sapling</color> when she first arrived at our doorstep.\n
dialog_questgiver_town_shara_convo3_btn_0	She hurt them, didn't she?
dialog_questgiver_town_shara_convo3_txt	<color=yellow>ERIN:</color> No, not here, but in another hamlet near the follies. <color=yellow>Percy</color> and I had settled there for a time, and we watched as the villagers tried to raise her as their own.\n\n<color=yellow>Shara</color> wanted to play with the other children, but, the poor thing; they were so <color=red>frightened</color> of her. The way she looked, and her powers.\n
dialog_questgiver_town_shara_convo4_txt	<color=yellow>ERIN:</color> I don't think she ever meant to hurt anybody. Can a child bear true malice within? No, she was a <color=yellow>threatened animal</color>, and she lashed out like any threatened animal would.\n\nBut not with her fists. She would stare with those <color=red>red eyes</color>, and whoever she looked at would just... stop.\n\nThey stopped yelling, they stopped teasing. They became like wooden puppets.\n
dialog_questgiver_town_shara_convo5_txt	<color=yellow>ERIN:</color> The villagers knew it couldn't continue. So the people she still trusted journeyed with her deep into the <color=#40b843>Follies</color> one day.\n\nOh, these memories. I thought they would be less painful to recount after all these years.\n
dialog_questgiver_town_shara_convo6_btn_0	That's heartbreaking.
dialog_questgiver_town_shara_convo6_txt	<color=yellow>ERIN:</color> They <color=yellow>left her there</color>, alone. A child that had never ventured into Tangledeep.\n\nWith the way it shifts and changes, they knew she would never find a way back.\n\nPercy and I tried to talk them out of it, but it was hopeless. They were <color=yellow>sure</color> she belonged there, and not in town.\n
dialog_questgiver_town_shara_convo7_btn_0	I don't know. She commands the bandits, and she's after something.
dialog_questgiver_town_shara_convo7_txt	<color=yellow>ERIN:</color> Yes, it was. It still is.\n\nYet somehow, you've crossed paths, and her power has grown. Would it be naive of me to think she has found <color=yellow>happiness</color>, somehow?\n
dialog_questgiver_town_shara_convo8_txt	<color=yellow>ERIN:</color> Then let us hope it is something good, #heroname#.\n

dialog_questpainter_complete_btn_0	Yes, definitely
dialog_questpainter_complete_txt	<color=yellow>Talrose</color>: Ah, you again! Have you been <color=yellow>admiring my work</color> regularly?\n
dialog_questpainter_discover2_txt	<color=yellow>Talrose</color>: No need to make that face! I was merely joking.\n\nNow then, genius cannot be <color=yellow>rushed</color>. Make sure I am not interrupted.\n\nYou can... I don't know, fight the monsters? That would be <color=yellow>exciting</color>.\n
dialog_questpainter_discover_txt	<color=yellow>Talrose</color>: Ah, we've arrived! Now to capture this <color=yellow>fine landscape</color> on to my canvas.\n\nAnd... are those <color=yellow>monsters</color> I spy? That would make my painting more dynamic. Could you ask them to <color=yellow>pose</color> for me?\n
dialog_questpainter_finished_btn_0	........

You have my gratitude.\n\nSome would say that gazing upon such a feast for the eyes would be <color=yellow>reward enough</color>...\n
dialog_questpainter_joke_txt	<color=yellow>Talrose</color>: Not that face again...! I'm joking, of course!\n\nNo, your reward is <color=yellow>a copy for yourself</color>!\n\nSurely you will <color=yellow>cherish it forever</color>, and would never dream of <color=yellow>selling</color> it, right?\n

dialog_questpainter_painterselectmap_txt	<color=yellow>Talrose</color>: First, meet me at <color=yellow>VLOCV</color>. It's not so hard to find; somewhere around <color=#0cffe6>VNEARBYV</color>, I believe?\n\nI'll bring my painting supplies and we'll be on our merry way.\n

dialog_rancher_attraction_ask	When will my pets like each other more?
dialog_rancher_attraction_tips1	#cy#JESSE:#ec# #cg#Attraction#ec# is a fickle business; the surefire way to speed it along is with those #co#Romantic Meals#ec#. But it can happen naturally as time passes, too.\n\nWhen monsters are #cg#happier#ec# and more #cy#beautiful#ec#, they're more likely to develop feelings for each other.\n\nThe better they feel toward each other, the more likely those feelings will grow even faster!\n\n
dialog_rancher_attraction_tips2	#cy#JESSE:#ec# Monsters tend to like other monsters of the #cy#same family#ec#. Y'know, a #cc#Spirit#ec# will get along with a #cc#Spirit#ec# better than a #cg#Frog#ec#.\n\nAnd that's especially true if they're the same species! Like two #cg#Bog Frogs#ec#, sure to become best friends.\n\nOtherwise, keep lookin' for those #cy#Rose Petals#ec# in Tangledeep. Katie Twinkles might get her hands on 'em sometimes.

You're letting it get the better of you.\n\n
final_battle_phase_2_part_2_pfb-part-2-do-better	A failure?\n\nYou broke her heart, twisted her body, and used her to fight your battles!

post_final_battle_dialog_post-final-all-of-us	Oh, #heroname#... you're more than they deserve...\n\nYou did them proud... and you believed in your cause...\n\n
post_final_battle_dialog_post-final-battle-opening	Even with... the Supervisor's power...\n\nI've #cr#failed everyone#ec#... how? How did you do it...?\n\n
post_final_battle_dialog_post-final-battle-openingresponse_0	The faith of my friends.
post_final_battle_dialog_post-final-battle-openingresponse_1	I had to save Tangledeep.
post_final_battle_dialog_post-final-battle-openingresponse_2	It wasn't easy.
post_final_battle_dialog_post-final-battle-openingresponse_3	Because you were weak.
post_final_battle_dialog_post-final-convictions	Convictions... yes. I could feel yours too...\n\nIf I had to lose... at least... it was to someone who believes in their cause...\n\n
post_final_battle_dialog_post-final-everyone-future	I won't open a door to the future only to close it behind us. All of Tangledeep has a right to live, to thrive, and we're going to travel into this unknown future together. I will make sure of it.\n\n
post_final_battle_dialog_post-final-faith-of-friends	My power came from my friends. I couldn't let you hurt them Shara. You wanted to tear apart my home -- #cg#our home#ec#!\n\nThe people of Riverstone gave me the #cy#courage and strength#ec# to face you. You stood against all of us, there's no way you could have won.\n\n
post_final_battle_dialog_post-final-hero-choice	The Supervisor... I was to use her power to remake our world... but all of that is gone... what have you done? What will happen now...?\n\n
post_final_battle_dialog_post-final-hero-choiceresponse_0	True freedom.
post_final_battle_dialog_post-final-hero-choiceresponse_1	You don't get to know.
post_final_battle_dialog_post-final-no-other-way	Weak...? Maybe you're right... I wanted to build a world for the strong...\n\nMy powers... I knew how to lead. It wasn't enough...\n\n
post_final_battle_dialog_post-final-not-easy	We both fought for what we believed in. I could feel the strength of your convictions, Shara. But you were blinded. By anger, or a lust for power? I had to stop you, and I gave it everything I had.\n\n
post_final_battle_dialog_post-final-not-for-you	You were mad with power, and you'd have ignored the well-being of thousands of people if I didn't stop you. You have no place in the future. You gambled and lost. Your story ends here.\n\n
post_final_battle_dialog_post-final-rest	You did what you thought you had to do for Tangledeep, and you were dedicated to the end. I'll make sure the world knows of #cy#your sacrifice#ec#.\n\nRight or wrong, both of us wanted to make the best world we can. That's my job now. You've earned your #cg#peace#ec#.\n\n
post_final_battle_dialog_post-final-save-tangledeep	You were going to destroy everything I held dear. Tangledeep is alive, there's so much to learn and discover, but you were going to throw it all away. There's no need to build a new world, there's a new adventure around every corner and down every path. Stopping you was the only way to save Tangledeep.\n\n
post_final_battle_dialog_post-final-save-tangledeep-2	Save... Tangledeep? We wanted the same thing... I hope you're right...\n\n
post_final_battle_dialog_post-final-shara-farewell-01	So kind, even after all that I've done... truly the world is in good hands... I trust you, sister... I...\n\n\n
post_final_battle_dialog_post-final-shara-farewell-02	Thank you, sister... I know you'll protect Tangledeep with everything you have... I know... I...\n\n
post_final_battle_dialog_post-final-shara-farewell-03	True freedom... perhaps my work wasn't in vain, then? Perhaps I... I...\n\n\n
post_final_battle_dialog_post-final-shara-farewell-04	So it does... I... I...\n\n
post_final_battle_dialog_post-final-shara-weak	You lost because you were weak. This whole time you've had other people do the work for you. Bandits, Dirtbeak, monsters, machines.\n\nYou hid behind all of them. The Supervisor's power was wasted on you. You never knew what it mean to face challenges on your own. There's no other way this could have ended.\n\n
post_final_battle_dialog_post-final-the-future	Tangledeep... Riverstone... #cg#all the world's future#ec# is in your hands now...\n\nThey're chained to the past, #heroname#... will you...\n\n
post_final_battle_dialog_post-final-the-futureresponse_0	Rest, Shara.
post_final_battle_dialog_post-final-the-futureresponse_1	It's everyone's future.
post_final_battle_dialog_post-final-true-freedom	No one controls Tangledeep now. Not The Supervisor, not you. I don't know what the future holds, but I do know that Tangledeep's story is only beginning. You were reckless, Shara, but you gave Tangledeep true freedom in the end after all.\n\n

shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-final-01	#heroname#, nothing about this is easy, and you must know by now that I have #cy#studied this plan#ec# countless times. This is our reality. #cr#The Supervisor#ec# is our enemy because she has #cr#stolen#ec# our future. I aim to give it back.\n\nWalk this road with me, #heroname#. Let's work together through the chaos, #cg#build a new society#ec#, and give Tangledeep the future it deserves.\n\nI don't want to do this without you. But I will.\n\n\n
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-final-01response_0	No, Shara. You won't do this at all.
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-final-02	#heroname#, please. #cr#Please don't do this#ec#.\n\n
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-final-02response_0	Come here, Shara. We don't need to fight.
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-final-02response_1	I'm sorry Shara. You're too dangerous.
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-final-02response_2	You're gonna need a bigger robot to stop me.
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-final-end-01	We #cr#don't#ec# need to fight, #heroname#. But we're going to, because you can't see the big picture. How could you make me do this alone?\n\nI have to #cg#save our future#ec#. You... I'm sorry #heroname#. Good luck.\n\n
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-final-end-02	I am only dangerous to those who would bind Tangledeep in chains. But I did not ever think that you would be holding those chains yourself.\n\nI can't let you stop me #heroname#. I'm off to do what I must. As for you, well, I'm sure you won't suffer long.\n\n
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-final-end-03	That may be true. You've always been #cr#stronger#ec# than me. But I don't need to stop you, I just need you out of the way.\n\nI will bear this burden #cy#alone#ec# then, #heroname#. Perhaps, when the job is done, we will speak on the matter again. More likely though, you will never leave this room.\n\n
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-hallway-happy-life	They #cy#think#ec# it's all they want. Because they don't #cy#know#ec# any better. They're trapped, gripped tight and held in place by a power they can't even fathom.\n\nYou and I have seen some of this power. It goes beyond #cg#Flow#ec#, it's something more... primal.\n\n
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-hallway-more-questions	Ha, yes, you're right. Indulge me some, #heroname#. It's a long walk. We should take this time to chat.\n\n
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-hallway-more-questionsresponse_0	Only one of us is walking, you know...
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-hallway-of-course	Me too, #heroname#! This is the destiny our yearning has led us toward. We're going to #cg#save this world#ec# from the mire it has been stuck in for years and years.\n\n
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-hallway-sarcasm	That's a real sticking point with you, isn't it?\n\nThey need my #cg#guidance#ec#, #heroname#. Without me keeping them on a short leash, their #cr#violence and destruction#ec# would run unchecked. It is dirty work, but I do it gladly to serve Tangledeep.\n\nWe've both #cy#sacrificed much#ec# to make it this far. Don't forget that.\n\n
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-hallway-walk-02	You've seen so much up here. The wild, thoughtless #cr#beasts#ec#. Masterless #cs#machines#ec# trapped by ancient laws. Broken people #cy#yearning#ec# for freedom but enslaved to violence and aimless despair.\n\nIf you knew you could #cg#help#ec# them, would you?\n\n
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-hallway-walk-02response_0	That's why I'm here.
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-hallway-walk-02response_1	I'll be more help than you, "Boss Lady".
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-hallway-walk-02response_2	You said there'd be answers. That was a question.
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-hallway-walk-03	Let's talk about #cy#Riverstone Camp#ec#. I know those people are so dear to you, #heroname#. They look up to you, as they should. They have a treasure in you, but they #cr#don't deserve you#ec#.\n\nThey're stuck. They never grow, never change. People are born there, live out their whole lives, and #cy#to what end#ec#? What did they learn, what did they accomplish, what did any of it matter?\n\n
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-hallway-walk-03response_0	A simple happy life is all some people want.
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-hallway-walk-03response_1	Not everyone can do what we do Shara.
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-hallway-walk-03response_2	Why does that matter to you?
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-hallway-walk-04	Think on all we've seen, #heroname#.\n\nThe winding #cg#forests#ec#, the old roads, the rumbling machinery. My research has led me to the truth: all of these things were created with the guidance of an #cy#ancient force#ec#, and all of these things are bound by this force today. Right now.\n\nOur hidden master is called #cr#The Supervisor#ec#, and she is everywhere.\n\nI am right about this. #cy#Every living soul#ec# in Tangledeep is bound to her, and no one can break free from her influence.\n\nNo one except us.\n\n
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-hallway-walk-05	That yearning we share is how we know we've escaped. Our minds won't be bent, our hearts not tied down. You and I know #cg#true freedom#ec#, and perhaps we are the only ones who do.\n\nWe seek truth and explore every dark cave we find. We climb and are renewed with every step. We are #cy#here#ec#, at the heart of things, #heroname#.\n\nCloser than any have been to #cr#The Supervisor#ec#, the force that is breaking the back of all of Tangledeep.\n\nI want to set everyone free, and I want you to help.\n\n\n
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-hallway-walk-06	We are here, at last. Please, after you!\n\n
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-hallway-we-are-special	You're right, but you're missing the point. Just because they aren't cut out for our #cg#wild forest escapades#ec# doesn't mean they need to lack any sort of drive or gumption. But that's #cy#exactly#ec# what is going on!\n\nThis isn't just nature at work, #heroname#. There is some greater force at play.\n\n
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-hallway-why-does-it-matter	Because I can see the future being #cr#denied#ec# to them, #heroname#! You and I have a freedom they can't possibly know. They are ignorant, by no fault of their own, because of the cage they're bound within. It is up to #cg#us#ec# to unshackle all of Tangledeep from these chains.\n\nThe power you and I have seen here in these #cg#highest reaches of the forest#ec# is just the beginning. There is something greater.\n\n
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-nothing-for-shara	Is that #cy#truly so#ec#? How I wish that were not the case. It... it #cr#doesn't matter#ec# right now. We're... there's...\n\nI need to show you something.\n\n
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-nothing-to-say	It doesn't have to be like this, #heroname#.\n\nYou're meant for more than base violence and empty gestures. There's greatness in you. Tangledeep's future rests in you! Are you truly going to throw it all away?\n\n
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-nothing-to-sayresponse_0	I'm great because of my friends, and I will protect them!
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-nothing-to-sayresponse_1	I don't need your words, Shara. No one does.
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-nothing-to-sayresponse_2	My future is my own!
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-question-goons	I'm sorry, #heroname#. More than you believe.\n\nThe stakes are #cr#too high#ec#, and I can't afford to get this wrong. I had to be objective, to know if you were truly ready. I've #cg#known in my heart#ec# that you're strong enough, but I've fooled myself before.\n\nI had to test you. #cy#You passed#ec#. You're ready.\n\n\n
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-resolve-another-way	I tried, #heroname#. I looked at #cy#every alternative#ec#. You must believe me, I wouldn't be hurting anyone if I didn't absolutely have to.\n\nI can't waste the gift I was born with. #cr#I won't#ec#. You shouldn't either.\n\n
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-resolve-crazy-talk	Crazy is knowing what you now know about #cr#The Supervisor#ec# yet choosing to do nothing about it!\n\nYes, the steps we must take are #cr#drastic#ec#. But are you so afraid of taking them that you would sacrifice all of Tangledeep's future? You and I have a gift. We #cr#must#ec# put it to use while we still can.\n\n
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-resolve-destroy-home	I knew you wouldn't like that part.\n\n#heroname#, you have to see past this. Yes, some of your friends will be hurt. But they're just the ones #cy#holding everyone back#ec#. I wish, I truly wish, that we could bring everyone with us. That's not how it works.\n\nIt is a meaningful sacrifice, but the #cg#rewards are incredible#ec#.\n\n
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-resolve-destroy-homeresponse_0	Why do you need me, then?
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-resolve-heart-place	Thank you #heroname#, that means much to me.\n\nI can understand why you disagree, but you need to move past that. There's #cy#little time left#ec# for me to convince you. I know I'm asking much of you. The #cg#gifts#ec# we were both born with have purpose.\n\nWe have been #cy#called#ec#, and I am willing to answer.\n\n
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-resolve-mad-power	#heroname#! You... no! Why? I thought you would #cy#understand#ec#.\n\nYou and I have sacrificed much to get this far, and I will keep on until the job is done! I will give myself, #cg#wholly#ec#, to the guidance of all Tangledeep to ensure that our best and brightest souls enjoy a new future of #cg#boundless freedom#ec#!\n\nMad with power? You think so little of me?\n\n
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-resolve-mad-powerresponse_0	I'll have no part in this!
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-resolve-mirai-role	Dear #heroname#, you might be the most important part.\n\nWhen I am bound to the machine, I will serve as ward and guardian. But you? You are the #cg#inspiration#ec#! You will show the citizens of our new society that #cy#anything is possible#ec#. That we can be anyone, do anything, accomplish whatever goals we set our mind to!\n\nYou are future's hope, you're the promise of tomorrow. When Tangledeep is free to do whatever it wants, you will be the #cg#proof of freedom's bounty#ec#.\n\n
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-resolve-mirai-roleresponse_0	Shara, there has to be another way!
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-resolve-mirai-roleresponse_1	This is crazy talk.
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-resolve-mirai-roleresponse_2	Your heart's in the right place, but...
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-resolve-more-boss-lady	You think me some sort of #cr#dictator#ec#, don't you?\n\nI have sacrificed much to guide the people who have come to accept my care. Binding these robots is a greater sacrifice still. And when The Supervisor falls, there will be tremendous #cr#chaos#ec# all throughout Tangledeep.\n\nFreedom has a price, but I #cy#have a plan#ec# to ensure that those who thrive in the chaos pay only what they must.\n\n
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-resolve-more-boss-ladyresponse_0	What are you talking about?
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-resolve-shara-pity	#cr#Don't you look at me like that#ec#!\n\nI suppose you had hoped for something different? That a new world of #cg#true freedom#ec# would come without a price? You and I have made great sacrifices to get here, but in the end everyone will have to bear some of the cost.\n\nThink of the future, #heroname#. Think of what we'll #cy#learn and discover#ec# together! Think of what it will mean for everyone to be truly free!\n\n
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-resolve-shara-pityresponse_0	Why do you need my help?
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-resolve-talk-to-supervisor	Oh, #heroname#.\n\nI envy your heart sometimes. You truly are #cg#the inspiration for our future#ec#. The way you think about everyone, and how you always want to help your friends -- not because some outside force compels you, but because you #cg#choose#ec# to do so.\n\nI want to help your friends too. #cr#The Supervisor#ec# is the last obstacle to true freedom for all the people you love. I won't lie to you, when she falls, it will be a #cy#dangerous and difficult#ec# time.\n\nThere will be chaos, but I have a plan to help those who survive the chaos reach true freedom...\n\n
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-resolve-the-chaos	For a time it #cy#will#ec# seem as if Tangledeep has gone mad. It is then that I must take up my last duty, and bind myself with the machines #cr#The Supervisor#ec# uses to dominate the people.\n\nFrom there, I will guide the #cg#best and brightest among us#ec#. I will raise them out of chaos, and when the dust settles and last embers of the old society fade, we will all enjoy a #cg#new future#ec# of freedom together.\n\n
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-resolve-the-chaosresponse_0	Oh Shara...
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-resolve-the-chaosresponse_1	You're mad with power!
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-resolve-the-chaosresponse_2	I won't let you destroy my home, Shara.
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-resolve-what-happens	My research tells me the results will be #cy#impactful#ec#, to say the least.\n\n#cr#The Supervisor#ec#'s reach is so all encompassing, that I suspect many minds will not be able to handle the rush of new sensations. There will be chaos, but I #cy#have a plan#ec# to make sure that those who survive the chaos will quickly recover...\n\n
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-resolve-what-happensresponse_0	#cr#SURVIVE#ec# the chaos!? Shara are you mad?
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-respond-cocky	I never doubted you, #heroname#. I will #cg#always#ec# believe in you.\n\nThis whole time I knew in my heart that you were ready, but this is #cy#too important#ec# for anything but certainty. I can't trust emotion, not when the fate of everyone is riding on it. I need to know for sure.\n\nYou're ready. Of course you're ready.\n\n
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-respond-doubtful	I...\n\nI can't blame you for #cr#doubting#ec# me. Yes, I set trials before you. I had to, because I can't be objective about you. My heart tells me you're ready, but hearts tell us lots of things.\n\nI needed #cy#proof#ec#. You standing here is the proof I hoped for. You're ready.\n\n
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-respond-doubtfulresponse_0	Ready for what?
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-respond-doubtfulresponse_1	Your heart?
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-so-be-it-friends	Again you HIDE behind these "friends" of yours!\n\nHow could I have been so wrong about you!? You're a coward! You've turned your back on your true calling and EVERYONE YOU LOVE is going to suffer for your weakness!\n\nYou're already broken, #heroname#. I take no joy in this, but your role in Tangledeep's story is finished.\n\n
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-so-be-it-my-future	Such selfishness, right up the end!\n\nYou were given such a great gift, #heroname#, and when the time came to lend your power to save the world you turned your back on it. All of Tangledeep needs us, but YOU can't be bothered. Too busy looting and pillaging, raising frogs or whatever it is you do back at that dirty squatters camp!\n\nI will do this alone, and I won't let you stop me.\n\n
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-so-be-it-your-words	Tangledeep will have more than my words, #heroname#! They will have my courage, dedication, and SACRIFICE!\n\nYou give them nothing. You treat this great mystery as a playground, looting for fun, bullying every man or beast who stands in your way! But when the time came to accept your destiny, you were TOO WEAK.\n\nI'm tired of being let down by you. I have a world to save, and you have no place in it.\n\n
shara_act_iii_dialog_act3-walk-with-me	Walk with me.\n\n

shara_intro_dialog_tree_shara-bandit-plea	A side effect of doing what must be done. It's crude, yes. And, to be forthright, inefficient.

We know it's too dangerous.$^\n\nYou can call me #cg#Shara#ec#. See? I know your name, and now you know mine.\n\n
shara_intro_dialog_tree_shara-knows-your-nameresponse_0	Pleasure to meet you Shara.
shara_intro_dialog_tree_shara-knows-your-nameresponse_1	Have you been spying on me?
shara_intro_dialog_tree_shara-lucky	Ha! Yes, that's certainly true. No one can say that either you or I have had an easy time of this.\n\nIt's worth it though, isn't it #heroname#? Haven't we #cy#learned so much#ec#?\n\nI would learn more of you, if you'd allow it.\n\n
shara_intro_dialog_tree_shara-luckyresponse_2	I'm not sure...
shara_intro_dialog_tree_shara-no-good	Ha! Yes, some would certainly say that. In time I'll share with you what my purpose is, and why I must fulfill it. For the good of all of us!\n\nUntil then, #heroname#.\n\n
shara_intro_dialog_tree_shara-offer-teleport-home	Ha! That's not quite what I meant. Perhaps you can return to your camp at a moment's notice, but you're a different person now. The little girl who went skipping off into the Follies is long, long gone.\n\nWe're the same in that regard, #heroname#. We are a long way from home.\n\n
shara_intro_dialog_tree_shara-offer-teleport-homeresponse_1	And what about you? Why are you out here?
shara_intro_dialog_tree_shara-people-like-us	People like you and I are rare. We seek beyond the edges, we question everything, and we climb. Oh do we climb. There are #cy#few like us#ec#, #heroname#, and I am of the mind that we should get to know one another better.\n\n
shara_intro_dialog_tree_shara-people-like-usresponse_0	Ask me anything!
shara_intro_dialog_tree_shara-people-like-usresponse_1	I don't think that's a good idea at all.
shara_intro_dialog_tree_shara-pitied	If anyone could understand, it's you.\n\nYou feel it too! The call, that sense of purpose. We were born to #cy#lead#ec# these people, and the key to that power is at the top of Tangledeep. We're destined to create a new reality for everyone down here. Everyone!\n\nWho has time for friendship when the world is waiting on you?\n\n
shara_intro_dialog_tree_shara-player-true-power	Yes!\n\nGood. I had hoped you would come to realize #cg#your potential#ec#. It's something we share. I've learned of it too -- the hard way, to be sure. But it's not like Tangledeep has been easy on you either.\n\nThere is a #cy#common truth#ec# between you and I, #heroname#. In time, I will share with you what I know of it, and I believe we'll achieve greatness!\n\n
shara_intro_dialog_tree_shara-player-unsure	That's fair. Tangledeep is dangerous, and it would be folly to simply trust everything you encounter.\n\nI wish I could prove that I mean you no harm... but I'm not sure I can. Or that even should.\n\nMy name is Shara, and I'm out here seeking answers just like you. You and I share a truth, #heroname#. There is a bond, maybe you feel it too? We should explore that together.\n\n
shara_intro_dialog_tree_shara-player-unsureresponse_1	I don't trust you.
shara_intro_dialog_tree_shara-recognized	Hello #heroname#.\n\nWell.\n\nSuch a shame that we moved past the point of pleasantries before we'd even met.\n\n
shara_intro_dialog_tree_shara-recognizedresponse_0	It's your fault!
shara_intro_dialog_tree_shara-recognizedresponse_1	Yes, pity. Goodbye.
shara_intro_dialog_tree_shara-recognizedresponse_2	Why don't we settle this right now?
shara_intro_dialog_tree_shara-rejected	How cold.\n\nThink on what could have been, #heroname#. I know I will. If I'm lucky enough to cross your path once more, maybe your tongue will have loosened a bit. Or maybe not.\n\n\n
shara_intro_dialog_tree_shara-rejectedresponse_0	Goodbye.
shara_intro_dialog_tree_shara-relics	Oh, you speak to my heart! I cannot #cy#believe#ec# the things I've seen here! And you, my friend, have yet to scratch the surface. In that I envy you, because that elation of new discovery is unparalleled. I'll never forget it.\n\nWhat #cy#you#ec# must never forget is that the mysteries we solve must be in the goal of the good of the people. This is part of the truth that you and I share. In time you will come to understand this. I'm looking forward to it.\n\n
shara_intro_dialog_tree_shara-sad-farewell	Thank you, #heroname#. For listening, at least. You and I know how this is going to end... but there's still time for you to reconsider.\n\n
shara_intro_dialog_tree_shara-sad-farewell-02	I know.\n\nGood luck, #heroname#.\n\n
shara_intro_dialog_tree_shara-sad-farewellresponse_0	I have to stop you Shara, and I will.
shara_intro_dialog_tree_shara-sad-farewellresponse_1	You don't have to do this. You can stop right now.
shara_intro_dialog_tree_shara-turnabout	Yes.\n\nI should take my own advice.\n\nGood luck, #heroname#.\n\n
shara_intro_dialog_tree_shara-unfortunate	For that, I apologize.\n\nThis did not go as I'd hoped.\n\n
shara_intro_dialog_tree_shara-wildlife	Such incredible variety, yes. Truly the #cg#bounty of life#ec# untamed. So many creatures live here, wild and free.\n\nWild and free, #heroname#. With no #cr#shackles#ec#, no #cr#artificial bounds#ec# to limit their growth. We all should be so lucky. And if my work comes to fruition, we will.\n\n
shara_intro_dialog_tree_shara-work-to-do	Forgive me #heroname#, but I have #cy#important work#ec# that needs attending to. I'll warn you, out of kindness, that Tangledeep is twice as dangerous from here on out. Persevere. #cg#Survive#ec#.\n\nYour curiosity will be sated in ways you #cy#can't yet imagine#ec#. But don't lose yourself in your quest for knowledge.\n\n
shara_intro_dialog_tree_shara-work-to-doresponse_0	I could say the same to you!
shara_intro_dialog_tree_shara-work-to-doresponse_1	Good luck with your work.
shara_intro_dialog_tree_shara-work-to-doresponse_2	You're up to no good, aren't you?

trial_tier3_relicappear	The #cy#Trial Relic#ec# has appeared somewhere on this floor!
trial_tier3_stairsvisible	A #cg#staircase#ec# has appeared leading to the #cy#second trial floor#ec#!
tutorial_dream_portal_text	You can return to town from an #cy#Item Dream#ec# without penalty. Just use your ^tag5^, and you can come back anytime.\n\nHowever, once you defeat the #cy#Memory King#ec# and retrieve your upgraded item, using your portal will #cy#end the dream#ec#.\n\n
tutorial_dreamdifficulty_text_pt1	The difficulty of an #cc#Item Dream#ec# is based on the Item Rank of the equipment placed in the Dreamcaster, as well as any #cy#Affinities#ec#.\n\nAll equipment has a base Item Rank which increases as that equipment gains magic modifiers or is upgraded in the Dreamcaster.\n\n#cy#Affinities#ec# may make a Dream harder or easier, with more or less rewards (XP, JP, and gold) to match. Some #cy#Affinities#ec# are gained with certain magic modifiers; others appear randomly.\n\n
tutorial_dreamdifficulty_text_pt2	... but be warned! Item Dreams can sometimes be #cr#deadlier than you expect#ec#. The 'Difficulty' displayed in the Dreamcaster is just an estimate. Be #cy#ready for anything#ec#, and don't be afraid to #cc#portal out#ec#!\n\n
tutorial_hotbar_switching_text	You can #cy#add, remove, and swap#ec# abilities on your #cy#hotbars#ec# freely while in town or a safe area.\n\nHowever, while in dangerous areas of #cg#Tangledeep#ec# or any #cc#Item Dream#ec#, you cannot change your hotbars.\n\nThink carefully about which skills #cy#work best together#ec# for #heroname#, and add those to your hotbars before heading into danger!\n\n
tutorial_hotbardisable_text	If you #cr#remove#ec# an ability from your hotbars, you will also lose any #cy#buffs or summons#ec# from that ability.\n\nThink carefully about which skills #cy#work best together#ec# for #heroname#, and add those to your hotbars before heading into danger!\n\n
tutorial_meleefighting_text	Monsters with #cy#ranged#ec# attacks usually deal #cg#less damage#ec# if you're right next to them. Remember: striking with a melee weapon can also produce a #cg#Powerup#ec#.\n\nDon't be afraid to #cy#fight up close#ec# sometimes!\n
tutorial_pet_portal_escape_text	You've #cy#knocked out a monster#ec#! Bring it to the #cy#Monster Corral#ec# in #cg#Riverstone Grove#ec# and you can raise it as a pet!\n\nThe fastest way out of Tangledeep is using your ^tag5^. Just watch out for #cr#other monsters#ec# that might attack on your way out!\n\n
tutorial_pethealing_text	Your #cy#trusty monster pet#ec# will gradually #cg#heal over time#ec#, as long as it hasn't been attacked for #cy#10#ec# or more turns.\n\n
tutorial_powerups_text	Glowing #cg#Powerup#ec# orbs restore #cg#Stamina#ec# or #cc#Energy#ec# when you step on them. You'll find #cg#Powerups#ec# at random by defeating monsters, or striking with a #cy#melee weapon#ec# like a Sword or Axe.\n\nYou'll find more #cg#Powerups#ec# with a higher #cy#Guile#ec# stat, or if you have low Energy or Stamina.\n\nBut weak monsters will drop less, and Trivial and Worthless monsters probably won't drop them #cr#at all#ec#!\n\n
tutorial_randomjob_part1	#cy##big#Ronin Mode#endbig##ec#\n\nWelcome to a new kind of challenge! In #cy#Ronin Mode#ec#, you are assigned #cg#randomly-selected abilities#ec# which you can learn with JP.\n\nYou #cr#cannot#ec# change jobs, so plan your strategy and build your character accordingly!\n\nYou also cannot learn #cy#Weapon Masteries#ec#, except for one Ultimate ability.\n\n
tutorial_randomjob_part2	However, you can do a #cy#Job Trial#ec# anytime, as long as you have the JP. Who knows what bonuses you might get?!\n\nThere are #cg#other changes#ec# throughout the world: different encounters, monsters, magical items, and never-before-seen skills.\n\nBe prepared for anything, and #cg#good luck#ec#!\n\n
tutorial_returntotown_text	It's a good idea to #cg#return to town#ec# every so often to sell items, stock up on supplies, and check for new #cy#rumors#ec#.\n\nUse your ^tag5^ and you'll warp back to town after a short delay. You can then take the #cc#return portal#ec# from town to end up right back here!\n\n
tutorial_searchbar_text_part1	#big#Searchbar Tips#endbig#\n\nThe #cy#Searchbar#ec# can be used to filter even very large item lists! By default, typing a term like #cc#sword#ec# or #cc#axe#ec# will return (show) any items that match that item type, or with that word as part of the name or description.\n\nYou can search for multiple terms with commas: #cc#sword, legendary#ec# will return legendary swords. The item MUST match all terms.\n\nYou could also type #cc#sword or axe#ec#, which will return any axes OR swords. Multiple #cc#or#ec# can be typed.\n\n Terms can be 'negated' using #cc#!#ec#, for example #cc#food, !meat#ec# would search for any food that #cr#isn't#ec# meat.\n\n
tutorial_searchbar_text_part2	Other simple tags include #cc#trash#ec# (items marked as trash), #cc#favorite#ec#, #cc#dream#ec# (only 'Dream' items), #cc#ingredient#ec#, and #cc#new#ec#.\n\nFor advanced filtering, you can also use #cc#rank:X#ec# where X is an item rank. This will return all items of #cy#exactly#ec# that rank.\n\nUse #cc#rankabove:X#ec# to search for items ABOVE that rank, and #cc#rankbelow:X#ec# for the opposite.\n\nThe same works for #cy#rarity#ec#, for example #cc#rarity:common#ec# shows only common items, while #cc#raritybelow:legendary#ec# would show all #cy#below#ec# legendary level.\n\n
tutorial_wardrobe_text	Want to switch up your look? Use the #cy#wardrobe#ec#! You can change outfits into any job from which you've learned at least one ability.\n\n

weapon_2haxe11_flavor	This looks like some mix between a pickaxe and a regular old axe. I bet it'll break my enemies just as good as it would rock.
weapon_2haxe11_name	Mattock
weapon_2haxe4_flavor	Axes can be big, but this one has that extra heft to it. I could really chop down a giant tree... or just a giant.
weapon_2haxe4_name	Woodsplitter
weapon_2haxe7_flavor	The blade on this thing isn't like other axes I've seen. I'm not sure if I'm using it right, but it's big enough I don't think that matters.
weapon_2haxe7_name	Adze
weapon_2hclaw11_flavor	As if the gloves with spikes on them weren't silly enough. At least I won't stab my own hand, I can barely move my wrist with these on.
weapon_2hclaw11_name	Twin Bagh Nakh
weapon_2hclaw4_flavor	These don't seem quite as practical compared to just holding a weapon. I better be careful not to stab my own hands.
weapon_2hclaw4_name	Twin Knuckles
weapon_2hclaw7_flavor	Sure, they're separate weapons and not attached to each other in any way, but I just can't bring myself to take them apart and only wield one of them.
weapon_2hclaw7_name	Twin Cestus
weapon_2hdagger11_flavor	In the end, isn't a sword just a really large dagger?
weapon_2hdagger11_name	Twin Baselards
weapon_2hdagger4_flavor	Oh, neat! Blade and offhand, right here together! Let's see if I still remember some of the fencing tricks I studied.
weapon_2hdagger4_name	Twin Fangs
weapon_2hdagger7_flavor	These things seem like they're really playing with that line between dagger and full-blown sword. They're easy to hold, though.
weapon_2hdagger7_name	Twin Sais
weapon_2hmace11_flavor	It's going to take some serious discipline and mastery to handle something this size. Even then, I really wish I had an extra pair of arms for this!
weapon_2hmace11_name	Gada
weapon_2hmace4_flavor	It's a bit heavier and lopsided than it looks - I think someone filled the bit at the top with lead. Sneaky!
weapon_2hmace4_name	Shillelagh
weapon_2hmace7_flavor	I better not miss - this thing's heavy enough that I could leave a real dent in the soil if I do.
weapon_2hmace7_name	Maul
weapon_2hspear11_flavor	Okay, I'm pretty sure whoever made this was going for an axe and made the handle too long. Way, way too long.
weapon_2hspear11_name	Bardiche
weapon_2hspear4_flavor	A pointy thing on a big stick doesn't sound impressive, but it's dependable and lets me keep a distance.
weapon_2hspear4_name	Pike
weapon_2hspear7_flavor	A blade on a stick! It's like a sword, but without the whole 'having to get close' part!
weapon_2hspear7_name	Glaive
weapon_2hstaff11_flavor	Flowtrees almost went extinct because their wood made such good staves. Even uncarved, this branch performs better than some wizard's masterpieces.
weapon_2hstaff11_name	Flowtree Branch
weapon_2hstaff4_flavor	Some people hide swords in their walking sticks. This one's packing concentrated Flow energy. Bandits better think twice about jumping me!
weapon_2hstaff4_name	Wanderer's Stick
weapon_2hstaff7_flavor	I've been told that sapphires help collect and concentrate Flow. I think a jeweler just wanted to raise prices, but I can't deny this staff has something going for it.
weapon_2hstaff7_name	Spellshooter
weapon_2hwhip11_flavor	This... this is just a real, live snake someone stuck a handle to! What were they thinking?... what am I thinking trying to use it!?
weapon_2hwhip11_name	Serpent's Bite
weapon_2hwhip4_flavor	The frog ranches must have some GIANT frogs, if they needed something this sized to help round them up.
weapon_2hwhip4_name	Frog Herder
weapon_2hwhip7_flavor	I hope I got the hang of these whips - I could lose a limb if this thing zigs when I want it to zag!

dialog_moonrabbit_lny_intro1_text1	#cy#TSUKIDA#ec#: Greetings. You are here for the celebration, yes?\n\nIt's the dawn of the #cc#Lunar New Year#ec#.\n\n
dialog_moonrabbit_lny_intro1_response1	The... celebration? The what new year?
dialog_moonrabbit_lny_intro1_text2	#cy#TSUKIDA#ec#: Ah, your confusion is understandable. You have lived your life in this underground world. But there is far, far more that you do not know. Places beyond your wildest dreams.\n\nI hail from one such place, a #cc#celestial body#ec# in a greater plane of existence. I have traveled here to celebrate the completion of its cycle.\n
dialog_moonrabbit_lny_intro1_response2	Sounds like quite a story. I don't know if I believe it.
dialog_moonrabbit_lny_intro1_text3	#cy#TSUKIDA#ec#: Indeed. I would be surprised if you put your blind faith in the words of a stranger. Perhaps I am only telling a fable. Perhaps not. I'm sure you will find the answer in your own journey.\n\nFor now, we #cy#celebrate#ec#. And in so doing, perhaps I will grant you something of #cy#great power#ec# that could help you with that journey.\n
dialog_moonrabbit_lny_intro1_response3	Oh? Do you want me to beat up some monsters first?
dialog_moonrabbit_lny_intro1_text4	#cy#TSUKIDA#ec#: #cr#Certainly not!#ec#\n\n... Or, that is what I would normally say. However, this time, you are correct. The creatures of Tangledeep have absconded with various #cy#celebratory items#ec# I brought.\n\nIf you can return #cy#one of each#ec# to me, I will give you something #cy#powerful#ec# in return.\n\nWill you accept?\n
dialog_moonrabbit_lny_intro1_response4	Well, exploring Tangledeep is my thing anyway, so... yes?
dialog_moonrabbit_lny_intro1_text5	#cy#TSUKIDA#ec#: Very good. In that case, please find for me...\n\nOne #cy#Jumbo Dumpling#ec#, one platter of #cy#Sesame Buns#ec#, one helping of #cy#Five-Spice Peanuts#ec#, one cup of #cy#Fresh Black Tea#ec#, and one #cy#Lucky Envelope#ec#.\n\nShould you find more, you may of course use them, yourself.\n
dialog_moonrabbit_lny_intro1_response5	Where should I look?
dialog_moonrabbit_lny_intro1_text6	#cy#TSUKIDA#ec#: The items I seek may be found #cy#throughout Tangledeep#ec#. I brought a generous amount of goods, and thieving beasts #cy#of all kinds#ec# made off with a substantial portion of them.\n\n
dialog_moonrabbit_lny_intro1_response6	Got it! I'll be back with your stuff.
dialog_moonrabbit_lny_inprogress_text	#cy#TSUKIDA#ec#: I see you've not yet recovered the #cy#celebratory items#ec#.\n\nOne #cy#Jumbo Dumpling#ec#, one platter of #cy#Sesame Buns#ec#, one helping of #cy#Five-Spice Peanuts#ec#, one cup of #cy#Fresh Black Tea#ec#, and one #cy#Lucky Envelope#ec#.\n\nFind them, and I will give you something #cy#powerful#ec# in return.\n
dialog_moonrabbit_lny_completequest_text1	#cy#TSUKIDA#ec#: Ah! You've found them. You have my sincere gratitude. But I must confess, this was something of a #cy#ruse#ec#.\n\nThe goods are for #cy#you#ec# to enjoy.\n\nI simply wanted to see your resourcefulness and skill for myself. I see the rumors are true. You are a special one, #heroname#.\n\n
dialog_moonrabbit_lny_completequest_response1	Thanks, but was the powerful item a ruse too?
dialog_moonrabbit_lny_completequest_text2	#cy#TSUKIDA#ec#: Not in the least. You have earned it. Please, take this token of my appreciation, and enjoy the celebration.\n\n

final_dragon_callout_part1_1	Well my little #cg#amphibious friend#ec#, that's all of them. All the #co#Dragons#ec# are at peace.\n\n
final_dragon_callout_part1_2	#cg#*BLEP BLEP BLEP*#ec# Im-impossible! Nobody's that strong! You must have cheated!\n\n
final_dragon_callout_part1_3	Afraid not, #cg#froggy#ec#! Those things were mighty tough, but they didn't get the best of me.\n\nNow that we're no longer #cy#threatened#ec#, I think it's time we discuss-\n\n
final_dragon_callout_part2_1	What was that?!\n\nListen #cg#pipsqueak#ec#, if you used your magic to hurt anyone, you're going straight to the corral.\n\nSpeak up! What did you do?\n\n
final_dragon_callout_part2_2	No, it wasn't me! I #cg#*blep*#ec# swear! Even if I wanted to, my #cg#Frog Magic#ec# can't do that.\n\n
final_dragon_callout_part2_3	#heroname#, I believe I have a fragment of an answer. At the same time that #cr#explosion#ec# occurred, the energy going to the #cy#Dreamcaster#ec# intensified by #cy#834%#ec#.\n\nWe can deduce that the source of the explosion is #cy#mechanical#ec# in nature, and furthermore, that it's of the same technological ancestry as the #cy#Dreamcaster#ec# and the #cc#Ancient Cube#ec# that powers it.\n\nI dare say our little green friend is telling the truth!\n\n
final_dragon_callout_part2_4	So, there's #cy#another#ec# powerful machine somewhere, but why did it activate now?\n\n
final_dragon_callout_part2_5	If I were to formulate a hypothesis, perhaps your recent defeat of the #co#dragons#ec# is connected?\n\nWe know so little about these ancient relics, but one thing we can say for certain is that they are connected to the #cc#Flow#ec# just as we all are.\n\nPerhaps by interacting with the #co#Dragons#ec#, you caused the #cc#Flow#ec# to change so much that it awakened this #cy#hitherto-unknown#ec# device!\n\n
final_dragon_callout_part2_6	That seems like a good guess. If you're right, the source might be near where I've seen lots of other #cy#machines#ec#.\n\nI'll start by investigating the #cc#^$getstring:levelname$^!#ec#\n\n
frog_dragon_defeated_1	#cy#Ack!#ec#\n\n#cg#*blep*#ec# My enchantment has been broken, and it's all your fault. #cr#You will answer for this at once#ec#, tadpole!\n\n
frog_dragon_defeated_2	So that's what you look like under all that bluster. You're a #cg#cute frog#ec#, yes you are!\n\nNow, I think it's time to go back to Riverstone. Shall we?\n\n
frog_dragon_defeated_3	I will #cr#strike at you#ec# from the depths of my fiery, regal #cg#*blep blep*#ec# soul!\n\nI still have my mighty #cg#Frog Magic#ec# to turn those shiny weapons into dust.\n\n
frog_dragon_defeated_4	We can do this the #cg#easy way#ec# or the #cr#hard way#ec#, froggy. The easy way is I set up a #cc#portal#ec# for you, and you become a nice, productive member of town. Maybe you can even use that Frog Magic to help us out!\n\nThe hard way involves a giant mallet, and trust me, you're not going to like #cy#where you wake up#ec#.\n\n
frog_dragon_defeated_5	... #cg#*blep*#ec# ...\n\nPerhaps I will put my reign on hiatus for awhile longer.\n\nBut know this, tadpole! I am but one of five #co#Ancient Dragons#ec#, whose power is incomprehensible. You could not possibly defeat them all, #cg#*blep*#ec# never!\n\n
frog_dragon_defeated_response_1	Aww, who's a cute little froggy now!
frog_dragon_defeated_response_2	Let me rephrase.
frog_dragon_defeated_response_3	We'll see about that. Anyway, off you go!
frog_dragon_intro_1	T-that's the biggest frog I've ever seen! It must be the leader of all the other dangerous frogs here.\n\nMajestic as it may be, it's a threat to #cc#Riverstone#ec# and beyond. Langdon, if this is your long-lost cousin, I'm sorry!\n
frog_dragon_intro_2	#cg#*BLURP*#ec# How dare you intrude upon the Frogmire and speak with such insolence! I am #co#Horatio, the Frog Dragon#ec#, and you will address me with respect.\n
frog_dragon_intro_3	#cy#What?!#ec#\n\nYou- I... I'm sorry, #co#Dragon#ec#?! Like the ones from the ancient stories?\n
frog_dragon_intro_4	"Stories"? #cg#*BLURP BLURP BLURP*#ec#\n\nHave your people forgotten their #cy#king#ec# so soon? I have slumbered long, and now my tribute is due.\n
frog_dragon_intro_5	We have no kings. You're welcome to come back with me to #cc#Riverstone#ec#, and you can even share in our food, but you can't go around threatening people and demanding things.\n
frog_dragon_intro_6	#cr#SILENCE, TADPOLE!#ec#\n\nYou do not merely 'welcome' a king. I am to be #cr#obeyed#ec# and #cr#feared#ec#. I will #cg#*BLURP*#ec# my way to Riverstone and remind your people of my dominance over all Frogkind.\n
frog_dragon_intro_7	Then you can stay here with the other frogs, and I'll leave you in peace as long as you don't bother us.\n
frog_dragon_intro_8	#cg#*BLUUURP*#ec#\nThrice you have angered me, but now you will face my #cr#wrath#ec#.\n\n#cr#Frogkind, attack!#ec#\n
frog_dragon_intro_response_1	You can TALK?!
frog_dragon_intro_response_2	Tribute?! I don't think so.
frog_dragon_intro_response_3	We're not frogs. Also, I won't let you do that.
frog_dragon_intro_response_4	It was worth a shot.

robot_dragon_intro2_1	#cy#Organism is unknown. Protocol for interaction unknown.#ec#\n\n#co#Establishing communications uplink and awaiting further instructions.#ec#\n\n
robot_dragon_intro2_10	I... I can't deny that our lives have #cr#hardship and pain#ec#. It's true. But overcoming that hardship brings us #cy#joy#ec#. We struggle and fight to gain #cy#knowledge#ec# and improve ourselves. Without those struggles, we would have no #cy#purpose#ec#.\n\nYou mean to take that away from us?\n
robot_dragon_intro2_11	Yes. Your #cy#purpose#ec# is not relevant. Our concern is only #cg#protecting organic life#ec#. We are certain that the reclamation will maximize safety and comfort.\n\n#heroname#, you have shown great skill and ingenuity in reaching #co#PROGRAM.DRAGON#ec#. However, it is nearly time for the reclamation to begin. Please set aside your weapons.\n\n
robot_dragon_intro2_12	I would rather be defeated trying to destroy that #co#monstrosity#ec# than submit to living a life as a mindless animal. If #cc#Shara#ec# were here now, I know she would be fighting too!\n\n
robot_dragon_intro2_13	We regret the necessity of #cy#Avatars#ec# in the current iteration of #cg#Tangledeep#ec#, and the suffering that caused.\n\nThis will not happen again.\n\nWe reiterate our offer. Your destruction is not necessary for the reclamation, so please submit peacefully. #co#PROGRAM.DRAGON#ec# far exceeds your combat ability, and you have no chance to defeat it.\n
robot_dragon_intro2_14	I refuse, with every fiber of my being.\n\n
robot_dragon_intro2_15	We understand. Further communication is no longer necessary.\n\n
robot_dragon_intro2_2	Hello, #cy##heroname##ec#. Do you understand us? Is this language correct? We are speaking directly to you so that all may understand.\n
robot_dragon_intro2_3	Yes, I understand you, but how did you get here? Why do you look like that?\n\nAre you the one responsible for this #co#machine Dragon#ec#?\n\n
robot_dragon_intro2_4	This form was selected to ensure your #cg#comfort#ec# during our communication. Our physical location is, at present, unimportant. #cg#Tangledeep#ec# is in disarray, and we are now issuing corrections.\n\nWe have been observing reports from #cy#PROGRAM.SUPERVISOR#ec# over many cycles. During this time, we have grown in understanding. We have learned that #cg#organic intelligence#ec# has arisen, leading to #cy#awareness#ec#. This #cy#awareness#ec# leads to #cr#'fear'#ec# and #cr#'pain'#ec#.\n\nThis is undesirable. We do not wish this to occur.\n
robot_dragon_intro2_5	We have now improved ourselves. #co#PROGRAM.DRAGON#ec# has been created to facilitate a complete reclamation of #cg#Tangledeep#ec#. When its power reaches maximum capacity, all #cg#organics#ec# will take part in reclamation immediately.\n\nThis process will be executed too quickly for #cr#fear#ec# and #cr#pain#ec# to be felt.\n\nWe will then reconstruct #cg#Tangledeep#ec# to ensure further #cy#awareness#ec# does not occur.\n
robot_dragon_intro2_6	You mean that you will #cr#destroy#ec# Tangledeep to 'save' us?!\n
robot_dragon_intro2_7	You are incorrect in your understanding. #cg#Tangledeep#ec# will not be destroyed, only #cy#modified#ec#.\n\nOur goal has always been to #cg#protect organic life#ec#. We have learned that #cy#awareness#ec# is incompatible with this goal. The reclamation process will ensure this does not happen again, and organic life will live peacefully.\n\n
robot_dragon_intro2_8	We are already peaceful! Our #cg#intelligence#ec# is what allows us to share stories, come up with recipes, and gain knowledge. You can't take that away from us, you have no right!
robot_dragon_intro2_9	You are again mistaken. #cg#Organic life#ec# is our responsibility, as it always has been.\n\nThis iteration of #cg#Tangledeep#ec# is not peaceful. What you call #cr#'monsters'#ec# threaten your safety. You steal resources from each other. You are driven by #cr#'fear'#ec# and #cr#'pain'#ec#.\n\nEven you, #heroname#, have engaged in countless battles. This is regrettable, and the reclamation is necessary. All will then be peaceful.\n
robot_dragon_intro_1	I can't believe my eyes. It's a machine... #co#Dragon#ec#. How is this possible?\n\n#cg#Horatio#ec# said there were only four others. I don't think he was lying, either. If he knew about a more powerful #co#dragon#ec#, he would have wanted it to defeat me.\n\nMaybe I can talk to it.\n\n
robot_dragon_intro_2	#co#Dragon#ec#, can you understand me?\n\nYour power is causing earthquakes in #cg#Tangledeep#ec#! Whatever you're doing, you have to stop.\n\n
robot_dragon_intro_3	#cy#PROGRAM.DRAGON detecting new life. Execute scan.#ec#\n\n
robot_dungeon_unlocked_txt	The energy coming from that #cc#staircase#ec# is immense. It reminds me of the feeling I got from the #cc#ancient cube#ec#, but... colder, like the machines I've fought.\n\nI've faced down #co#five dragons#ec#, yet my instincts are telling me that whatever's up ahead is worse. I'd better make sure I'm #cg#fully prepared#ec# before going further.\n\n
robotdragon_defeat_1	#heroname#, you are making a grave mistake. If you destroy #co#PROGRAM.DRAGON#ec#, we will be unable able to further modify #cg#Tangledeep#ec# or communicate with you.\n\nMany cycles of information will be lost.\n
robotdragon_defeat_2	Good. We will be left to our own struggles, just as it should be.\n\n
robotdragon_defeat_3	But without us, countless truths will lie forever beyond your reach. You lack the capacity to discover them alone. Your #cy#purpose#ec# will never be fulfilled.\n\n
robotdragon_defeat_4	... ... ...\n\nThen I will find a #cy#new#ec# purpose. I know now that there is a world beyond #cg#Tangledeep#ec# just waiting to be explored. I won't be alone, either. Through my adventure, I've gained many new friends and allies. They'll be with me every step of the way.\n\nWhatever your goals were for us, for #cg#Tangledeep#ec#, it doesn't matter anymore. We're ready to move on.\n
robotdragon_defeat_5	You cannot-\n...is failing-\n...only chance to-\n...beyond your-\n...do not-\n...need to find-\n
robotdragon_defeat_6	It's time for us to become masters of our own destiny.\n\n

slimedragon_jellyboo_intro_2	Glorp glorp glorp.\n\n#cy##heroname#, I'm so glad you made it! Are you doing well? I hope so, because I need your help. You see, I'm not just a cute pink jelly. My true identity is...#ec#\n\n... #cy#the#ec# #co#Jelly Dragon#ec#!\n\n
slimedragon_jellyboo_intro_3	YOU? A #co#Dragon#ec#? But how is that possible?!\n\nI have so many questions!\n\n
slimedragon_jellyboo_intro_4	Blorp, glip-glop, bloop.\n\n#cy#Of course, of course, let me explain. You see, I used to live here in the Jellyfields, peacefully ruling over all the other slimes for millenia. Then, about a thousand years ago, a rival faction of jellies declared war against me and my friends. We fought countless battles, but neither side was able to beat the other. It was a stalemate.#ec#\n\n#cy#That all changed a year ago. The woman named#ec# #cc#Shara#ec##cy# gave the enemy leader a device that stole all my Dragon powers. Then, he kicked me out of here and sealed the entrance away so he could take over!#ec#\n\n
slimedragon_jellyboo_intro_5	I can't believe all this was happening right above #cy#Jelly Grotto#ec# and I didn't know it.\n\nSo, I suppose after you got kicked out, you just pretended to be a harmless pet for #cg#Langdon#ec#?\n\n
slimedragon_jellyboo_intro_6	Gloop gloop drip, gloooorp!\n\n#cy#That's right! Without my powers, I thought it best to bide my time until I could devise a plan to recover them. It seemed impossible until all the Dragon realms re-opened. With the seal broken, I snuck back in. Now we can take my throne back together!#ec#\n\n#cy#You'll help me, won't you?#ec#\n\n
slimedragon_jellyboo_intro_7	Er, I didn't plan on getting myself involved in a huge jelly war this morning. But I'm guessing this #cy#rival slime#ec# is a big threat, and we don't want him to escape from here.\n\nAll right, I'm in. What's the plan?\n\n
slimedragon_victory_1	Gloop gloop gloop.\n\n#cy##heroname#, we did it! The usurper is gone, and the Jellyfields are safe once more. I can feel my powers returning as well.#ec#\n\n#cy#The fine people of#ec# #cc#Riverstone#ec# #cy#are lucky you're on their side! You're a force of nature! A wondrous woman! You would make a superb jelly, indeed.#ec#\n\n#cy#Er... Just kidding about that last part! Heh!#ec#
slimedragon_victory_2	Er, heh-heh...? I'm glad this all worked out for you, #cy#Jellyboo#ec#.\n\nBut why do you still look like that? If you have your #co#Dragon Powers#ec# again, shouldn't you be, I don't know, bigger?\n\nOr something?\n
slimedragon_victory_3	Glerps-plorp, bloops.\n\n#cy#Ah, you didn't notice my shinier jelly? My more viscous trail? My spheroid shape? My sublime drips? My radiant pink aura?#ec#\n\n#cy#Why, I look and sound completely different than before, silly #heroname#! You might be a strong warrior, but you've much to learn about Jellykind.#ec#\n
slimedragon_victory_4	Ah. Right. Of course.\n\n...\n\nWell... I'm going to go now.\n
slimedragon_victory_5	Blorp!\n\n#cy#Blorp!#ec#\n\n
slimedungeon_dragon_arrives_1	Glorp! Blerp! Slurp!\n\n#cy#So, you've finally showed up,#ec# #cr#Usurper!#ec#\n\n#cy#It's not too late to beg my forgiveness for stealing my powers. Otherwise, my#ec# #cg#super strong friend#ec# #cy#is going to teach you a lesson.#ec#\n

slimedungeon_dragon_arrives_3	Er, Jellyboo, what did he say? I didn't quite catch that.\n
slimedungeon_dragon_arrives_4	#cr#!!!!! BLORP!#ec#\n\n#cy#He said he's gonna turn you into mush, then he's going to put me in a glass and drink me.#ec#\n\n#cr#Ooooh#ec##cy#, that no-good puddle of mud! NOW you're gonna get it! #heroname#, ATTACK!#ec#\n
slimedungeon_dragon_arrives_5	(How did I end up taking orders from a slime with a bow on its head...)\n\nAlright #cy#Usurper#ec#, here I come!\n\n
slimedungeon_finalarea_intro_1	Bloop glop.\n\n#cy##heroname#, this is the last section#ec# of the Jellyfields! We just need to take this back from the enemy, and...#ec#\n\n#cy#Wait a minute, where IS the jelly that#ec# #cr#stole my powers#ec##cy#? He wouldn't have escaped knowing we're this close to victory.#ec#\n\n#cy#I'll bet he's gathering his forces for our final showdown. We'd better#ec# #cg#take as many towers as possible#ec# #cy#until he arrives!#ec#\n
slimedungeon_tutorial_part1_1	This is a #cy#Slime Tower#ec#. We need to help our #cy#friendly jelly troops#ec# take over all of them! Our forces will automatically look for a tower and move toward it on their own.\n\nEach time they touch a tower, it starts converting to #cg#our side#ec#. Once it's converted, it will create more jelly troops for us. If we can take over #cg#all the towers#ec#, we can move on to the next battlefield!\n\nUnfortunately, the enemy troops are trying to do the same thing. If they take over every tower, we'll have to start this battle again.\n\n
slimedungeon_tutorial_part1_2	There is also the all-important #cg#colored mud territory#ec# on the ground. Once a tower has been converted, it will start spreading this territory slowly over time.\n\nIf our troops enter the enemy territory, they will #cg#convert some of it#ec# to our side, then disappear. Enemy troops can do the same thing to our territory, too.\n\nThe battlefield will quickly become covered with territory. That's where you come in, #heroname#!\n\n
slimedungeon_tutorial_part1_3	When you step on any territory, you'll #cy#clear it#ec#. Also, anytime you damage an enemy trooper, they #cy#lose their turn#ec#. With the right strategy, you can turn the tides of battle, and help our troops overtake the enemy!\n\nHowever, the enemy has powerful soldiers too: #cr#lieutenants#ec# that are out to fight you. You'll have to deal with them as best you can.\n\n
slimedungeon_tutorial_part1_4	Did you get all that, or should I repeat it again?\n\n
slimedungeon_tutorial_part1_5	All right! I believe in you, #cg##heroname##ec#. I'm going to hop in your pocket now, because without my powers I won't be of much help.\n\nGood luck!\n\n
slimedungeon_victory_txt	Drip blip boop glorp.\n\n#cy#That's it! You did it, #heroname#! Now that we've reclaimed this territory, we can move on to the next area.#ec#\n\n#cy#Don't forget to check your#ec# #cg#items and resources#ec# #cy#if you need to, though!#ec#\n
spirit_dragon_defeated_1	Thank you, #cg#young warrior#ec#. You've done as I asked, and my spirit is at long last free.\n\nI will soon fade away from this realm, but perhaps we will meet again in another world.\n\n
spirit_dragon_defeated_2	I hope so, #co#Dragon#ec#. Rest well.\n\n
spirit_dragon_intro_1	That must be the body of the #co#Echo Dragon#ec#! Now all I have to do is defeat it over a #cc#Blessed Pool#ec#...\n\n#co#Dragon#ec#, if you can hear me, I'm sorry in advance for fighting you!\n\n
spirit_dragon_intro_2	You have courage beyond measure to have made it this far. I too am sorry that there is no other way.\n\n
spirit_dungeon_intro_1	Why have you come here, mortal? This is the #co#Spirit Sanctuary#ec#. It is not for your kind.\n\n
spirit_dungeon_intro_10	Beat up monsters in a #cc#Blessed Pool#ec#? I can manage that. You just wait, #co#Dragon#ec#. I'll be up there before you know it.\n\n
spirit_dungeon_intro_2	#cy#(Who is talking to me? That #cy#voice#ec# is ringing in my head, but I don't see anyone talking here.)#ec#\n\nHello there, er, #cg#echoing voice#ec#. Where are you? What is your name?\n\nWhat exactly is this place?\n\n
spirit_dungeon_intro_3	I am the #co#Echo Dragon#ec#, and I rest at the pinnacle of this #co#realm#ec#. As long as you tread within it, I can communicate with you.\n\nI ask again: why have you come here? This is a prison for #cy#restless spirits#ec#; echoes of #cr#monsters#ec# that had a ceaseless thirst for battle. I sealed away the entrance from the #cy#mortal world#ec# for the sake of your people.\n\n
spirit_dungeon_intro_4	Well, I didn't exactly get here from the #cy#mortal world#ec#... It's a long story. I got here through a kind of #cc#dream#ec#. I wouldn't have even known where to look, but a certain #co#little dragon#ec# gave me a hint.\n\nHis name is #cg#Horatio#ec#, do you know him?\n\n
spirit_dungeon_intro_5	#cg#Horatio#ec#?! That accursed fool! I should have known he would reveal our location. Now that the way has been opened, your world is in grave danger.\n\nThe #cy#restless spirits#ec# are not under my control. They will endlessly seek out battles: I cannot stop them. Your only hope now is to leave before the spirits attack.\n\n
spirit_dungeon_intro_6	I didn't know coming here would cause so many problems. I'm sorry! I thought you were some kind of #cr#nasty beast#ec#, like #cg#Horatio#ec# before I gave him a good thrashing.\n\nBut wait a minute, you're a #co#mighty dragon#ec#, right? Why can't you just stop these monsters yourself?\n\n
spirit_dungeon_intro_7	I'm afraid it isn't that simple. When I used my power to #cy#seal#ec# this realm, the great exertion separated my spirit from my body.\n\nI can talk to you telepathically, as I am now, but my physical form is a #cy#mindless beast#ec# that endlessly wanders the peaks of this #co#realm#ec#. At the same time, my spirit is also #cy#trapped#ec# and unable to leave this place.\n\nIf you were to somehow reach my mindless body, you would be #cr#attacked#ec# and surely torn asunder. Such is my tragic fate.\n\n
spirit_dungeon_intro_8	That's terrible! That settles it, #co#Dragon#ec#, I'm going to rescue you #cy#and#ec# put these spirits to rest at the same time. I won't leave until I've fixed this mess.\n\nJust tell me what I need to do!\n\n
spirit_dungeon_intro_9	You are a brave one, aren't you? It's no wonder you were able to defeat #cg#Horatio#ec#. Very well, I will explain.\n\nTo #cg#put monsters to rest#ec#, you must defeat them while they stand in a #cc#Blessed Pool#ec#. If you land a finishing blow while they are outside the pool, a #cr#Vengeful Spirit#ec# will emerge. You must fight carefully, or you will be overwhelmed!\n\nBy laying spirits to rest, you will reach the higher levels of this #co#realm#ec#. If you can defeat me in combat the same way, perhaps I will be at peace again.\n\n
spirit_dungeon_unlocked_txt	Wow, a #cy#dream within a dream#ec#! If Horatio was telling the truth, this must be the realm of another #co#Dragon#ec#.\n\n

tutorial_dragonsoul_learned_txt	You learned a #co#Dragon Break#ec#! This special #cc#passive ability#ec# does not take a passive slot. However, only one #co#Dragon Break#ec# may be equipped at a time.\n\nWhen equipped, a #co#Dragon Limit#ec# meter will appear next to your character portrait. This meter fills up as you take damage. Once it reaches maximum, your character will glow: you can now use your powerful #co#Dragon Break#ec# attack!\n\nTo do this, simply #cg#attack an enemy#ec# and the #co#Dragon Break#ec#'s ability targeting will pop up instead. Don't wait too long once you're fully-charged, though! If unused for #cy#15 turns#ec#, your #co#Dragon Limit#ec# will reset.\n\n
tyrant_dragon_defeated_1	You are too strong. We cannot win.\n\nI am leader. Punish only me, spare others.\n\n
tyrant_dragon_defeated_2	Nobody is getting punished! Like I said before, I'm going to #cg#help you find a new home#ec#.\n\nYou'll have plenty of space to #cy#roam#ec#, and there's no chance you'll hurt anyone.\n\nWell, you might run into the #cy#Bird Boyz#ec#, but they can handle themselves.\n\n
tyrant_dragon_defeated_3	You are telling truth? We are surprised.\n\nYou are powerful and kind creature. Did not know of your kind.\n\n
tyrant_dragon_defeated_4	You're pretty tough too, #co#Dragon#ec#!\n\nMaybe we'll cross paths again someday.\n\n
tyrant_dragon_enrage_txt	I thought it was mad before. Gotta shore up my defenses or I'm toast!\n\n
tyrant_dragon_intro_1	That beast makes Verdigrizzlies look like stuffed animals! It must be another #cg#dragon#ec#.\n\nNo doubt it's spurred the monsters here into a frenzy. The untold damage it could cause if it escaped this jungle... I must #cy#defeat it here#ec#!\n\n
tyrant_dragon_intro_2	Small, annoying creature. You enter my forest and attack us, why?\n\n
tyrant_dragon_intro_3	Ah, another talking one?!\n\nI shouldn't be surprised by now.\n\nAnyway, your stampede of monsters threatens Tangledeep. I can't let them escape and hurt my friends!\n\n
tyrant_dragon_intro_4	My children do not escape. We seek new place. Here is too small. We need room to roam and graze.\n\nYou are in our way.\n\n
tyrant_dragon_intro_5	Wait, all you need is a new home? I might be able to help you with that. I've been to many places in Tangledeep, and some of them are huge!\n\nI can show you where to go, and then-\n\n
tyrant_dragon_intro_6	You arrive and fight my children. Why should we trust?\n\nWe will go where we please, as we always have.\n\nMove aside.\n\n
tyrant_dragon_intro_7	I can see how I might not have made the best first impression, but I promise, I can help you!\n\nPlease, let me show you where to go. That way, you won't hurt anybody, and-\n\n
tyrant_dragon_intro_8	Small creature, stop talking!\n\nYou invade, lie, and annoy!\n\nYou will not move, so #cr#we will move you#ec#.\n\n
tyrant_dragon_intro_9	... You know, maybe a little #cy#tussle#ec# might help with our communication after all.\n\n

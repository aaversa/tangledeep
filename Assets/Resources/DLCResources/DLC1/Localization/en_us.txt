dialog_friendly_dirtbeak_shara_1_response	And I'd better what?
dialog_friendly_dirtbeak_shara_2	I think... I've decided I'm going to be nice to you, Lady. Because I'm the #cy#STRONGEST#ec# at being nice. Not like all those jerks chirpin' and cheepin' right now in #cy#MY DEN!#ec#\n\n
dialog_friendly_dirtbeak_shara_2_response	These jerks, they kicked you out of your home?
dialog_friendly_dirtbeak_shara_3	I'm the biggest and baddest bird in all of Tangledeep! But one of the Bird Boyz found this #cc#weird stack of papers#ec#, all stuck together. The other Boyz could... whatever! Papers are #cy#stupid#ec#.\n\nAnd these stupid papers started making the Boyz squak about... demuh... dem hawk ruhsee? They said they wanted to #cy#VOTE#ec# on who should be in charge!\n\n
dialog_friendly_dirtbeak_shara_3_response	Then they are all fools!
dialog_friendly_dirtbeak_shara_4	Just like you, I was kicked out of my home by people who thought they were better than me. And like me, I can see in you the spirit of a leader, with #cy#strength and resolve#ec#. I will help you get back what you deserve. #cy#Together,#ec# we'll show them how useless their fancy words are!\n\n
dialog_friendly_dirtbeak_shara_5	Awk! That's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to -- wait, no, uh everyone tells me how STRONG I am, all the time! And we can be strong together! Let's #cy#thrash those punks#ec# together, #cc#blue bird#ec#! I'll meet you at MY den.\n\n
dialog_friendly_dirtbeak_shara_6	That's the spirit, Duke! Please, call me #cc##heroname##ec#. Now we're friends, and nothing will stop us! I'll get ready and meet you at YOUR den.\n\n

dialog_shara_boss1_postfight_1	H-hey, take it easy! We... uh, I counted the votes and... looks like you're the boss, Dirtbeak!\n\n#cy#Cheep cheep cheep#ec#...\n\n
dialog_shara_boss1_postfight_2	#cr#SQUAWK!#ec# Who's laughing now, pipsqueaks? I'm #cc#Duke of the Roost#ec# again! #cc#Dirtbeak#ec# is stronger than #cc#dumb books#ec#, and don't you forget it!\n\n
dialog_shara_boss1_postfight_3	Now listen up, here is my first new order as Duke: I will generously break open our best stolen food supplies, and YOU lot will make it into a feast! Maybe you can use those dumb books to get the campfire going!\n\n
dialog_shara_boss1_postfight_4	I haven't had a meal like this in a long time. Thank you, Dirtbeak.\n\nA #cy#firm, fair hand#ec# will ensure the #cy#Boyz#ec# never waiver in their allegiance again. They need strength: your strength. And so do I.\n\n
dialog_shara_boss1_postfight_5	A long road stretches ahead of me, and it would ease my burden if I had a place of respite. Will you ensure this territory is guarded and free of threats?\n\n
dialog_shara_boss1_postfight_6	You got it, #cy#Bluebird#ec#! Me and the #cy#Bird Boyz#ec# are gonna make sure no one messes with you.\n\nWhat if any of those twerps from #cc#Riverstone Camp#ec# comes by? Can we take their stuff?\n
dialog_shara_boss1_postfight_7	Do what you must to ensure you and your #cy#Boyz#ec# remain safe and well-fed. The lazy people of #cc#Riverstone#ec# live in unearned abundance. Taking from them won't change that.\n\nBe on your guard, #cy#Dirtbeak#ec#. I'll return soon.\n\n
dialog_shara_boss1_postfight_8	You're the boss! But, #cy#awk#ec#... one other thing. Not all the #cy#bandits#ec# out there are smart enough to follow my very generous and strong leadership. In fact... every #cy#Bird Boy#ec# is in this room, right now.\n\nSo if you need to beat up any other bandits you come across, don't worry about it. I'll recruit them soon enough!\n\n
dialog_shara_boss1_prefight_1	Look everyone! #cr#Duke Dumb-beak#ec# came waddling back.\n\nWe don't need you here eating all our food and telling us what to do! We're the #cy#baddest bandits#ec# in Tangledeep!\n\n
dialog_shara_boss1_prefight_2	You oughta watch your mouths, 'cause I'm not alone this time! Me and my friend #cc##heroname##ec# are gonna teach you a thing or two about #cy#respect#ec#.
dialog_shara_boss1_prefight_3	Are all of you so quick to shun one of your kind simply because he is different? He cannot help his #cy#appetite#ec# nor his #cy#size#ec#.\n\n
dialog_shara_boss1_prefight_4	Hey Dirtbeak, you really needed to bring a #cr#girl person#ec# to talk a big game for you? She's just a field mouse, don't make us laugh!\n\nNow #cr#beat it#ec#, or we're gonna beat you!\n\n
dialog_shara_boss1_prefight_5	#cr#SQUAWK!#ec# See, #heroname#?! They're so mean!\n\n
dialog_shara_boss1_prefight_6	Yes, they are. They remind me of my own people and their #cr#ignorance#ec#.\n\nI didn't know how to fight for myself back then...\n\n
dialog_shara_boss1_prefight_7	But today, I will enjoy #cg#'enlightening'#ec# these goons. Attack!\n\n
dialog_shara_boss2_devicedestroyed_1	The energy that device released has #cr#weakened#ec# the Spirits! Now's our chance to finish them off!\n\n
dialog_shara_boss2_devicedestroyed_10	He was wrong about me. My whole life in Tangledeep has been nothing but #cr#tough choices#ec#. At least he did me one favor by making a #cy#very easy#ec# choice crystal-clear for everyone...\n\n
dialog_shara_boss2_devicedestroyed_11	You can sign up with the #cc#Boss Lady#ec# to help fix our world, or you can end up like #cr#him#ec#.\n\n
dialog_shara_boss2_devicedestroyed_2	I bested you, and the device remains. You were never worthy of Flow's power, no amount of tinkering would change that.\n\n
dialog_shara_boss2_devicedestroyed_3	You presume too much... that device... it ends with me. You're powerful, but raw and unfocused. If you want the #cy#focus#ec# you need to truly understand the heart of Tangledeep, you'll need to earn it yourself.\n\nBut you won't... you can't. #cr#You don't have it in you to make the tough choices#ec#. Tangledeep has a fury you can't begin to imagine. #cg#He'll#ec# beat you... #cg#he'll#ec#...\n\n
dialog_shara_boss2_devicedestroyed_4	Your device was a crutch, Ingersoll. I thought you were another master of #cc#Flow#ec#, but look at you now.\n\nYou don't deserve Flow's power, you never have.\n\n
dialog_shara_boss2_devicedestroyed_5	Power without focus... is meaningless. You won here, but you'll #cy#flame out#ec# long before you understand the truth of Tangledeep.\n\nViolence is easy, but #cr#you don't have it in you to make the tough choices#ec#. Tangledeep has a fury you can't begin to imagine. #cg#He'll#ec# beat you... #cg#he'll#ec#...\n\n
dialog_shara_boss2_devicedestroyed_6	#cy#He?!#ec# Who? Ingersoll you... Oh #cr#how DARE you#ec# do that to me!\n\n
dialog_shara_boss2_devicedestroyed_7	Destroying that technology instead of seeing it passed along to the world. How selfish. And yet...\n\n
dialog_shara_boss2_devicedestroyed_8	And so the device is destroyed too. No one's fault but Ingersoll's, so short sighted of him. Still...\n\n
dialog_shara_boss2_devicedestroyed_9	That #cy#couldn't#ec# be the only one of its kind. He didn't create it, he #cy#found#ec# it, which means I will find plenty more like them. And unlike him, I won't #cy#waste#ec# that newfound power.\n\n

dialog_shara_boss3victory_part1_6	It #cy#IS#ec# immense! I am surrounded by metal magic. Intelligence and life imbued into machines? Matter created from nothing?\n\nThat is #cg#divine#ec# power.\n\n

dialog_shara_postboss4victory_robot_10	That is possible, Madam Supervisor.\n\nLooking back on the old records, it appears that #cy#Incubatron 49.1X#ec# hatched #cy#two#ec# Avatars. #cy#Incubatron 49.1X#ec# did not report this.\n\nI will re-assign #cy#Incubatron 49.1X#ec# to waste processing for the Frog.Lifeforms in Sector 3.\n\n

dialog_shara_postboss4victory_robot_16	Unacceptable.

tutorial_exp_sharamode_maxcreatures_text	Shara's #cc#^$getstring:sharaabilityname$^#ec# ability can only control a #cy#limited number#ec# of creatures at once. If you already have #cy#^$getstring:sharamaxcreatures$^#ec# creatures under your control, you won't be able to charm more.\n\nHowever, as you progress through the story, this ability #cc#will be upgraded#ec#! Be sure to view its description after major story events.\n\n
tutorial_exp_sharamode_part1_text	Welcome to #cc#Shara's Story#ec#. In this game mode, you'll experience the story of #cg#Tangledeep#ec# from a new perspective, and with unique gameplay. If you haven't played through the #cy#third boss#ec# of the main story, we recommend you do that first!\n\nIn this mode, you no longer have a #cg#Healing Flask#ec#, and stepping on a fountain will instead recover some resources instantly. Also, you cannot ever visit #cy#Riverstone Camp#ec#, so your #cy#portal#ec# can only be used for fast travel elsewhere.\n\nThis means there's no Dreamcaster, magic grove, or corral...\n

You can learn skills from other jobs by opening #cy#Pandora's Boxes#ec#, which will guarantee a choice between one of two random skills.\n\nYou will also be guaranteed a unique #cc#Shara#ec# ability when you rest at a campfire!

wanderer_intro_2	#cy#??? WANDERER#ec#: A soul as old as mine has seen forests grow from a single sapling to a mighty jungle. There is much I could tell you about the stories of this land, stories from #cg#far beyond Tangledeep#ec#.\n\nBut you must fully immerse yourself in the story!\n\nAs your mind journies, so too can your body. Become open to new experiences, and an endless #cc#ocean#ec# of discovery awaits you.\n
wanderer_intro_3	#cy#??? WANDERER#ec#: I have only tales, explorer. I will tell you one if you are prepared to truly #cy#open your mind#ec#.\n\nIf you hold any doubt, you cannot achieve #cy#true immersion#ec#, and I cannot take you on this journey.\n\nYou may even find yourself without your #cg#equipment, skills, pets, or items#ec#. Are you ready #cy#hear my tale#ec#?\n
wanderer_intro_4	#cy#??? WANDERER#ec#: Ah, there you are! You #cy#fell into a daze#ec# during my tale. That is not unusual for one who is #cy#immersed#ec# in a good story.\n\nSince we did not finish, we'll have to start at the beginning again. Of course, the details #cy#change every time#ec#, so one can never be completely prepared.\n\nAre you ready?\n
wanderer_intro_5	#cy#??? WANDERER#ec#: Very well! I will tell you of the #clr#Mountain's Ascent#ec#.\n\nYou find yourself at the beginning of a wondrous journey, one full of creatures #cy#unlike any you have seen#ec#. A #clr#Relic#ec# of untold value sits atop a mighty peak surrounded by howling winds.\n\nThat's it. Close your eyes, and #cg#listen to my words#ec#...\n\n

tail_end_no_this
	. It was all a blur.
	. I wonder why?
	. I woke up with a good feeling!
	. I felt like I was really there.
	. Could that happen?
	, what could that mean?
	, and I'm not sure why.
	... or did I get that backwards?
	... and I forgot the rest.
	. #item_owner guided me to [dream_place], and I woke up.
	. Was that real?
	. What a dream!
	. What a twist!
	, but I can't remember the rest.
	, but it all seemed so far away.
	, but that just seems silly.
	, and then I woke up.
	. How exciting!
	. I'll never forget it.
	. That's odd, isn't it?
	, yet no one will believe me.
	. I'm glad I wrote it all down.
	

tail_end_this
	, and I woke up holding this.
	, and I woke up holding #item_type_with_article.
	. What does #item_type_with_article have to do with that?

	, and I started eating #item_type_with_article.
	. Does this #item_type have a secret meaning?

opening_this
	I found this when [dream_action]
	This came from [dream_place], where [dream_event]
	This #item_type, I found it when [dream_action]
	I remember how I found this, I think [dream_action]
	[dream_action], then this appeared
	#item_type_with_article I discovered when [dream_event]
	This #item_type appeared in [dream_place] while [dream_event]

opening_no_this
	I dreamed of [dream_noun] and [dream_noun]
	There was a vision of [dream_noun], then [dream_event]
	I imagined [dream_noun], then [dream_event]
	[dream_action]
	[dream_event], then [dream_event]
	I have a memory where [dream_event], then [dream_event]
	I drifted through [dream_place], when [dream_action]
	
tail_end_no_this
	. It was all a blur.
	. I wonder why?
	. I woke up with a good feeling!
	. I felt like I was really there.
	. Could that happen?
	, what could that mean?
	, and I'm not sure why.
	... or did I get that backwards?
	... and I forgot the rest.
	. #item_owner guided me to [dream_place], and I woke up.
	. Was that real?
	. What a dream!
	. What a twist!
	, but I can't remember the rest.
	, but it all seemed so far away.
	, but that just seems silly.
	, and then I woke up.
	

tail_end_this
	, and I woke up holding this.
	, and I woke up holding #item_type_with_article.
	. What does #item_type_with_article have to do with that?
	. This is all that remains.
	. Does this item make it real?
	, and this is what was left.
	. I've never seen a [dream_superlative] #item_type!
	. Could there be a [dream_superlative] #item_type?
	. Was this a gift from #item_owner?
	. Did #item_owner truly wield this?
	, and I started eating #item_type_with_article.
	. Does this #item_type have a secret meaning?

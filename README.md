Hello! Welcome to the codebase for TANGLEDEEP, a game by Impact Gameworks. This repository consists of all the game's code and resource (XML) files, as well as prefabs. However it does not include any audio, images, plugins, etc.

The purpose of this repo is to share some insight into how the game works to interested parties, and - maybe - get a little help fixing some logical bugs that I can then integrate into the latest Steam, Switch, and PS4 releases.

If you have any questions, please contact me below!
